---
## Authentication

- Laravel Sanctum for token-based authentication.
- Register or login to receive a token
- Include the token in the Authorization header.

## Role-Based Permissions

- `Admin:` → Full access to all resources
- `Manager:` → Can manage expenses but not users
- `Employee:` → Can view and create their own expenses

---
## API Endpoints

#### **Authentication Routes:**

- `POST /api/register:` → This is restricted to Admins only. Admins can create new users. (Done with middleware('role:Admin'))

- `POST /api/login:` → This allows everyone to log in, regardless of their role.

- `POST /api/logout:` → This is for logging out the authenticated user (uses Sanctum's token-based authentication).

#### **Expense Management:**

- `GET /api/expenses:` → Allows Admins, Managers, and Employees to view expenses. The ExpenseController@index method will be responsible for fetching expenses, ensuring they are filtered by company (using auth()->user()->company_id).

The list will be paginated and searchable by title/category, as specified.

- `POST /api/expenses:` → Allows Admins, Managers, and Employees to create an expense. The ExpenseController@store method ensures the expense is linked to the authenticated user's company.

- `PUT /api/expenses/{id}:` → Allows Admins and Managers to update expenses (as you mentioned).

- `DELETE /api/expenses/{id}:` → Allows only Admins to delete an expense.

#### **User Management:**

- `GET /api/users:` → Lists all users, restricted to Admins only.

- `POST /api/users:` → Allows Admins only to add new users.

- `PUT /api/users/{id}:` → Allows Admins only to update a user's role.
