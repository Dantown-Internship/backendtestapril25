# Setup Cron job
1. Add a cron job to run the Laravel scheduler every minute:
   # Open the crontab editor
   crontab -e
   
   # Add the line to run the scheduler
   * * * * * cd /home/your-user/backendtestapril25 && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1


Replace /path-to-your-project with the absolute path to your project directory in production.

2. Verify the scheduler is set up correctly:
   # View all cron jobs
   1. crontab -l
   
   # Check if the schedule is listed properly
   2. php artisan schedule:list

This cron entry will run every minute, but your job will only execute dailyAt  05:13 AM as specified in  Console/Kernel.php file.

# In production, remember to:
Configure a real mail server in your .env file instead of the log driver
Ensure Redis is running and properly secured
Monitor your logs for any issues with the job execution
