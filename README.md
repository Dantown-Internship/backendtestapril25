# Multi-Tenant SaaS-Based Expense Management API

This API provides a secure, high-performance multi-tenant expense management system built with Laravel. Multiple companies can manage their expenses independently with role-based access control and advanced features.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Complete data isolation between companies
- **Secure API Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum for token-based auth
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, Manager, and Employee roles
- **Advanced Query Optimization**: Eager loading, indexing, and Redis caching
- **Background Job Processing**: Weekly expense reports using Laravel Queues
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of expense changes

## üìã Requirements

- PHP 8.1+
- Composer
- MySQL or PostgreSQL
- Redis (for optimal performance)

## üîß Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/backendtestapril25.git
cd backendtestapril25
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
composer install
```

3. **Configure environment**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

4. **Configure your database in the .env file**

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=expense_management
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
```

5. **Configure Redis for caching and queues (optional but recommended)**

```
CACHE_DRIVER=redis
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

6. **Run database migrations and seeders**

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

7. **Start the development server**

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The API will now be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## üîë Default Admin Account

After running the database seeder, you can log in with:

- **Email**: admin@example.com
- **Password**: password

## üìö API Documentation

API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` after starting the development server.

### Importing Postman Collection

A Postman collection is available for testing the API:

1. Import the collection from: `/storage/app/scribe/collection.json`
2. Set up an environment variable `base_url` with value `http://localhost:8000`
3. Get an authentication token by using the Login request
4. Use the token for authenticated requests

### OpenAPI Specification

OpenAPI/Swagger documentation is available at:
- `/storage/app/scribe/openapi.yaml`

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
php artisan test
```

### Background Job Testing

To test the background job processing:

```bash
# Configure Redis
# Dispatch the job manually
php artisan app:dispatch-weekly-report-job

# In a separate terminal, run the queue worker
php artisan queue:work
```

See `tests/background_job_test.md` for detailed instructions.

### Advanced Feature Testing

For comprehensive testing of scheduler configuration, audit logging, and Redis cache performance:

```bash
# Test scheduler
php artisan schedule:list
php artisan schedule:run

# Check audit logs
php artisan tinker
App\Models\AuditLog::latest()->take(10)->get();

# Monitor Redis cache
redis-cli monitor
```

See `PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md` for detailed testing instructions and performance analysis.

## üë• Multi-Tenant Structure

- Each **Company** has multiple **Users**
- Users have different roles: Admin, Manager, or Employee
- Each **User** can create **Expenses** within their company
- All data operations enforce company isolation

## üîí Role-Based Access Control

- **Admin**: Full access to manage users and expenses
- **Manager**: Can manage expenses but cannot manage users
- **Employee**: Can only view and create their own expenses

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

- **Eager Loading**: Used throughout the codebase to avoid N+1 queries
- **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Redis Caching**: Implemented for frequently accessed data with automatic invalidation
- **Queue Processing**: Background processing for resource-intensive tasks

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production deployment, make sure to:

1. Configure a proper web server (Nginx, Apache)
2. Set up a process manager for queue workers (Supervisor)
3. Configure the Laravel scheduler in crontab:

```
* * * * * cd /path-to-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```
