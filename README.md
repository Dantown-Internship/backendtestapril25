## üß© Additional Notes, Considerations & Additions

### **Multitenancy via Global Scope**

A `CompanyScope` global scope is applied to all tenant-aware models to ensure tenant isolation. This guarantees:

-   Every query is automatically scoped to the authenticated user's company.
-   Data belonging to other tenants is not exposed or accessed by mistake.

This design enforces strict tenant isolation and prevents data leaks.

### **Authorization via Policies**

Laravel‚Äôs **Policy classes** are used to authorize expense-related actions (view, update, delete) based on user roles and company ownership. This ensures that users can only interact with resources within their permission scope.

### **Role Middleware & Helper for Clean Access Control**

A custom `RoleMiddleware` class restricts access to API routes based on user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee).  
The `roleMiddleware()` helper function generates middleware **aliases** and corresponding **role strings** dynamically, ensuring consistency and eliminating hard-coded role references in route definitions.

### **API Versioning**

To ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions, API versioning has been introduced. You can now specify the version of the API when making requests.  
Example:  
`GET 127.0.0.1:8000/v1/users`  
This approach allows new features and improvements without breaking existing integrations.

### **Expense Persistence on User Deletion**

Expenses are preserved even if a user is deleted. The `user_id` on the `expenses` table is nullable and uses `nullOnDelete()`, ensuring historical expense data remains intact.

### **Scoped Expense Listing**

-   **Employees**: Can only view their own expenses.
-   **Managers** and **Admins**: Can view all expenses within their company, including who created each expense.

### **Standardized API Responses Using a Trait**

API responses follow a consistent format through a custom `HasApiResponse` trait. This trait ensures success, error, and paginated responses have a unified structure, simplifying response handling for frontend consumers.

### **UUIDs for Public-Facing Identifiers**

UUIDs are used for public-facing identifiers in API responses and route parameters, avoiding exposure of internal auto-incrementing IDs. Internally, primary `id` fields are still used for efficiency.  
The `HasUUID` trait:

-   Automatically assigns an **ordered UUID** during model creation.
-   Enables **route model binding** using the UUID instead of numeric IDs, improving security and consistency.

### **Caching Strategy**

A dedicated `CacheKey` helper class ensures consistent cache key naming, reducing the risk of cache collisions. Caching is selectively applied as follows:

-   Dynamic data (like paginated records) **is not cached** due to frequent changes.
-   The list of **company admins** is cached and invalidated when admins are added, removed, or their roles change.
-   For paginated data caching, **full request URLs** (including query parameters) are used as cache keys.

### **Weekly Expense Report**

The **Weekly Expense Report** summarizes weekly expenses, showing:

-   **Total Amount**: Displays the total expenses incurred.
-   **Expense Breakdown by Categories**: Provides a detailed breakdown of expenses by category.
-   **Top 5 Spenders**: Lists the top 5 users with the highest expenses for the week.

### **Weekly Expense Report via Batching**

A custom Artisan command dispatches weekly expense report jobs using `Bus::batch()`. Each job aggregates the past week‚Äôs expenses and notifies all company admins with the report. This scalable design ensures fault-tolerant processing of reports across multiple tenants.

### **Audit Log Implementation**

An audit log system is in place to track all changes to sensitive models. To ensure proper type safety when creating audit logs, a custom cast was implemented that casts the changes JSON column to an `AuditLogChangesDto`. This ensures that all changes are typed and properly structured for easy retrieval and analysis.  
Admin users have access to the audit logs and can filter logs based on the **action** performed (update, delete) and the **time** the action occurred.

### **Indexing for Performance**

Since the application is multi-tenant, indexing was carefully implemented to optimize query performance. Composite indexes have been added to frequently filtered columns, ensuring efficient retrieval of data. There was no additional need to create an index on the `company_id` column as MYSQL automatically adds an index on foreign keys.  
Specifically, the following composite indexes were added:

-   `company_id` + `uuid` (for fast access to data by company and UUID)
-   `company_id` + `id` (for efficient access to primary key-based queries)

These indexes ensure that queries are executed efficiently, even when filtering large datasets across different tenants.

### **Code Formatting**

The project uses **Laravel Pint** for automatic code formatting. This ensures the codebase adheres to a consistent style, making it easier to maintain and collaborate on.

## üß™ Testing

-   All API endpoints were thoroughly tested using feature tests.
-   Assertions were made to verify the **correct JSON response structure**, status codes, and expected data outputs for each scenario.
-   The **weekly expense report** command and its dispatched jobs were also tested to ensure:
    -   Reports are correctly generated per company.
    -   Admins receive the appropriate notifications.
-   Writing the tests early made it easier to **refactor and improve the codebase** with confidence, ensuring changes didn‚Äôt break existing functionality

### Running Tests

To run the tests, ensure the **SQLite extension** is enabled for your PHP setup. Alternatively, you can modify the `phpunit.xml` file to use your preferred database connection. Once set up, you can execute the tests by running the following Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan test

```
