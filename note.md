#### Instructions for Testing

* To make migrations and seeds for the testing environment - always use the --env=testing flag (eg.  php artisan db:seed --env=testing)
* If any test fails, (except the [WeeklyReportMailTest](tests\Feature\WeeklyReportMailTest.php)), simply reset the tests db and try again.
